Extra attention should be given to wrapping the pointed ends of your silverware and knives.<br><br> Step 2: Silverware should also be grouped together and wrapped up in a sheet or two of paper. With your pantry items, be sure to tighten all of the lids and check that no containers have cracks or holes. Be extra careful with the liquids and oils because if these spill or leak, it will get everywhere and possibly even seep through the box into other boxes and furniture.<br><br> Step 3: Cutlery and other sharp items should be pointing in the same direction and labeled as “sharp” to avoid stabbing yourself; it’s also a good idea to wrap the ends of your bundled-up knives with a few layers of packing tape. It may be a pain to unwrap but is much better than slicing your hand open!`

If you need more info on purchasing moving boxes, check out our moving boxes calculator.<br><br> Step 2: Your pots, pans, and other heavy metal cooking gadgets should be wrapped in paper and loaded at the bottom of any box. As we discussed in our article on how to pack a kitchen, wrapping these heavy items will decrease the risk of damage to other items within the same box. <br><br> Step 3: Once you have a layer of stuff in the box, put some paper on top before you start packing other items. Sufficient padding is crucial to the safety of your kitchen-ware! It’s useful to nest the pots and pans together to save space. The lids can be wrapped together but be careful if you have glass lids to protect them properly. Be sure to be aware of the boxes’ weight as your packing the box. You should aim for a box weight of around 34 lbs  – 45 lbs max. You can pack other lighter items into the box to fill space without adding too much weight. If you want to make a very heavy box it will be important to use a dish pack box instead of a medium box to add structural integrity. <br><br> Step 4: Once your box is finished you should label it with the room, contents and any special notes. It’s most useful to label the box on the top and at least one side so that you can see the label when it’s stacked. If the box is heavier than ~35lbs you may want to label it heavy to prevent any injury during the moving process.`

        moreBlogText: `A long haul move is a complicated logistical process. It involves the coordination of packing, preparing, loading, transporting, and unloading hundreds of items over hundreds of miles – for just a single move. Most people are familiar with the loading mover, the one they call to get an initial estimate. However, during the vast majority of long distance moves there are actually three separate movers involved in your transaction, the loader, transporter, and unloader. For a more detailed explanation of why three parties are needed during cross country move, be sure to read our long distance moving: three parties article. This post will talk about the role of each of these movers and allow you understand the moving process better. <br><br> LOADER <br> The loading moving company is the most important party involved in your move. They are (or at least should be) your “mover”. They will be the one you call when you want an estimate, who you meet in person, and who you call when you have a question. Ultimately, they coordinate all the logistics for your move, they line up the other parties and are responsible for making your move as smooth as possible. In summary the loaders responsibilities are: <br>– Provides your initial estimate <br> – Accepts your down payment (and possibly final payment)<br> – Arranges the logistics for your move, hires the transporter and unloader<br>  – May provide the labor involved in the load of your move, packing your belongings, preparing them for shipment, loading them into the truck<br> – Provides the truck for ferrying if the semi-truck is unable to access your home<br> – Provides customer service and contact throughout the move. <br><br> TRANSPORTER: <br> The Transporter is the party responsible for taking your goods across the country. While they’re not required to load/unload your goods the driver will usually perform loading/unloading services with the help of your loader. They are a completely different type of business than your loading/unloading mover; they are a trucking company. Their job is to drive one or more trucks moving across the country, covering thousands of miles, picking up and dropping off goods. Sometimes your transporter may be a single individual who owns his/her own truck, other times they may be part of a larger fleet. When you select a Vanline to perform your move the transporter is almost always branded with that Vanline as a requirement of accepting those shipments. 
        However, they’re ownership is still completely separate from that of your loading/unloading mover. The Transporters responsibilities are: <br> – Provides the semi-truck to hold your belongings
        <br>– Provides all the non-consumable supplies to protect your furniture such as pads, straps, bulk heads, ramps, and decking.
        <br>– Drives the truck to your pickup location, attempts to park the truck as close as possible to your home
        <br>– Drives the truck across the country to your drop location, attempts to get as close as possible to your drop off home
        <br>– Provides customer service when concerning the delivery timeline <br><br>
        UNLOADER: <br>
        The unloader is the party that will vary the most depending on the mover that you chose for your initial estimate. It is also the least complicated task. Most reputable moving companies will hire experienced movers to handle the unload of your goods. The truck driver that handled your shipment may be one of the unloaders depending on their willingness to do so. The unloader is the party that is responsible to having the ferrying truck if it’s necessary for your move. The unloaders responsibilities are:
        <br>– Unload your shipment, setup your furniture, unpack if necessary
        <br>– Arrange ferrying of your goods if the semi-truck cannot access your home

Unlike plates, glasses go in the box like they do in the cupboard; you can have them right-side-up or upside-down, just as long as they are not sideways. Wine Glasses/Stemware/China: Wine glasses and other stemware should be packed with extra precaution. I recommend packing them in their own box (probably a small 1.5) and noting that they be “Top Load Only” meaning that it shall be placed on top of the heavier boxes. Additionally, these boxes should be labeled “fragile” on all sides in big, bold letters.`

Packing must be done correctly because a perfectly packed truck cannot make up for a poorly packed box as far as potential damage is concerned. The purpose of these articles is to provide people with free professional advice about the best strategies to use when packing each room of your house. We also have valuable articles dedicated specifically to kitchen packing, bathroom packing and home office packing.
        Items needed for every room are as follows:
        <br>• Boxes– they come in many sizes and each size has a separate purpose
        <br>• Packing paper– the best thing for keeping everything safely padded inside the box
        <br>• Tape– 2 inch width is best
        <br>• Markers– boxes should be labeled with its room destination and a short list of its contents. <br><br> Packing paper is a great commodity and should be used frequently as it will add padding and help to fill the box. Ideally, every box should be filled to the brim as it provides structural integrity thus reducing the potential of collapse and damage; a full box is a strong box. “The Shake Test” is a good way to test if the box is ready to be sealed. If nothing moves when the box is slightly shaken, it is ready. If there is movement, more padding should be added into the gaps. Clothing, towels, and other fabrics can also be used as a replacement for paper and to save some money. While this may seem like a good alternative, some warning must be made. These items could be damaged either by getting torn by the wrapped items or from whatever liquids may be packed. This method will also make unpacking difficult as items will be strewn throughout all of the boxes.<br><br> One area that is often overlooked is the bottom of the box; it is vital that the bottom of the box is strong so that it will not all out. There are many ways to secure the bottom but the best ways are seen in the photos. The first method (above) is done by taping a couple strips down the center and then one along both sides to form an “H.” This method provides for the best protection because every possible opening is covered with the tape. Another very good option (below) is to put a couple strips of tape down the center, as before, and then another strip or two running parallel on each side of the center strip. <br><br>After the box is taped but before placing anything into it, a lining should be placed at the bottom. A flat lining is done  simply by laying a sheet of paper in the box, as shown in the photo above. It protects the items from excessive rubbing against the inside of the cardboard box. Crumple lining, shown in the photo below, is done by crumpling sheets of paper and placing them in the box. This should be done when packing fragile items because it provides more protection; it also takes more paper to get a complete layer. <br><br>
        When the box has passed the shake test and is sufficiently full, it can be sealed and labeled. As stated before, the label should include the room (where it is going to or came from) and a list of the major items in the box (up to three). “PBO” can also be added to the label and it stands for “Packed by Owner.” This just helps to determine if an insurance claim can be made on broken items found in the box. Under the ITL-transporte policy, only items packed by the movers can be claimed if they are broken. `

        moreBlogText: `A common question can be, why are there three parties involved in the long distance moving process? Why can’t the mover I call for my estimate (the one I choose to do my move) be the only person involved? The answer: to make your move affordable by grouping shipments and avoiding deadheading (coming back with an empty trailer). In order to make everyone’s move  affordable each truck carries multiple shipments simultaneously and must travel to where the next shipment is waiting. If the truck instead just took one shipment to it’s destination and then returned not only would it likely come back empty but it wouldn’t be able to go to multiple destinations for other loads. Therefore, without this system each move would have to pay for the entire truck to make a special trip just for them making it prohibitively expensive. <br><br> For more information regarding the logistics of a cross country move, be sure to read our logistics of a long distance move article. <br><br>So why do you need more than one mover to avoid a deadhead, can’t the same mover just handle the whole shipment on their own? To understand the answer this it’s first important to understand the four logistical conditions required to make your move happen:<br> 1) There must enough space in the semi-trailer to accommodate your goods
        <br>2) The trailer has to be designed for household goods and have the proper equipment
        <br>3) The truck transporting your goods has be in your exact location on the exact day(s) you need it to be
        <br>4) The truck has to be heading in the direction your moving to <br><br> At first glance this might seem like a simple feat, but it’s actually not. If you think about it there are millions of miles to cover in the Continental US, multiplied by the 365 days in the year, a limited number of household goods trailers, and finally compounded by the various directions the truck must go. Since most movers only have enough resources to own a few trucks it makes the probability of all four of the above conditions extremely unlikely. Instead its necessary for them to tap into the thousands of trucks available in the entire market rather than just the couple they personally own.`

        Every time you move, there are several factors that determine the total time it takes to complete your move. How long does it take to move your house or apartment? Moving time is essentially based on the following formula with few exceptions: <br><br> 
        Some items that effect the time overall, in order of impact are: <br> <br>-How close we are able to park the truck to your location.
        <br>- How many flights of stairs.
        <br>- Long hallways/long carry out to the truck.
        <br>- How much furniture.
        <br>- How many boxes.
        <br>- How many odds and ends (unpacked items).
        <br>- Size of the elevator.
        <br>- How far your locations are from the carriers warehouse and between homes.
        <br>- Additional pickups and stops.
        <br>- How well prepared you are with where your items go within the home and whether items will fit.
        <br>- How many items need to be disassembled and reassembled.
        <br><br> 
        When planning for the cost of your move it’s important to understand whether or not your move fits within the average move. Remember, an average will contain people who are moving furniture only as well as those with a full house.

        When you’re moving long distance it’s important to chose the right kind of estimate before watching your entire household drive off into the sunset. To better familiarize yourself with the long distance moving process, we recommend our long distance moving: three parties and logistics of a long distance move articles.
        There are many long distance moving companies that may represent that they are movers, but there are a few core concepts to keep in mind: <br> 
        <br>- Never accept a firm over the phone bid, it’s illegal and completely inaccurate (general guesses over the phone are ok, just expect them to change).
        <br>- Completing an inventory form is a good start but understand that it will likely change. It can change drastically, so do not use it for budgeting purposes.
        <br>- Watch out for people that sound like their calling from a call center, they’re probably just brokering out your move to someone local and charging you twice as much to make up the difference.
        <br>- Always use a company that is local to the city that you are moving FROM so that you can get an IN PERSON estimate.
        <br>- Always get an IN PERSON estimate, you’d be surprised what the difference can be!
        <br>- When comparing quotes be sure to look at per pound or per linear foot rate (the total can be different with each mover and isn’t the best comparison), additional insurance options and rates, service times (guaranteed or not), and the time it will take to deliver the goods.
